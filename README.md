# rescript-fp-core
A functional standard library for ReScript.

An alternative to the ReScript Core library heavily inspired by fp-ts.

ReScript Core has a focus of providing bindings for JavaScript API's without having an opinion on those APIs. 
This library has a different philosophy of providing functions that are focused on functional patterns, and only offering a subset of Javascript APIs.

This library encourages immutable data and safe access that are often wrapped in Options.
